cat <<EOF 
This is (a wrapper for) the discspan.py script. It will take the contents of a  directory specified by --dir and burn it to one or more DVD's 
It is fussy about a couple of things. It doesn't always like it when a blank
disc is inserted before it is started and it really doesn't like it if you install a second (or third etc) disc before it is ready. It is not very clear (or at least disarmingly literal)  about the last part.

So when it says "press enter to continue" or some such, just press Enter! It it will prompt you for the disc when it is ready.

It is designed for lots of small files and can't cope with files bigger than the disc capacity.

You also need to watch out for the limits of the ISO file system e.g. filenames more than 32 characters long, containing odd characters etc.
